// A Research team want to establish a research center in a region where they found some rare-elements.They want to make
// it closest to all the rare-elements as close as possible so that they can reduce overall cost of research 
// over there.It is given that all the rare-elementâ€™s location is connected by roads.It is also given that Research
// Center can only be build on road.Team decided to assign this task to a coder.If you feel you have that much potential..
// Here is the Task :- Find the shortest of the longest distance of research center from given locations of rare-elements.

// locations are given in the matrix cell form where 1 represents roads and 0 no road..
// number of rare-element and their location was also given(number<=5)
// and order of square matrix was less than equal to (20).
